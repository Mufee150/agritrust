# AgriTrust Hub — Frontend

This folder contains the React + Vite frontend for AgriTrust Hub (mobile-first UI).

## Quick start

Requirements: Node 18+ and npm

1. Install dependencies
```bash
# Make sure you are in the frontend directory
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```powershell
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173/
```

3. Build production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```

## Styling notes
- The project uses the file `src/styles.css` for a modern mobile-first aesthetic (shadows, gradients, card layout). If you'd like Tailwind or Material UI added, I can wire that up.

## Admin login
- Admin password (dev only): `admin123` (see `src/pages/admin/AdminLogin.tsx`). Replace with a Vite env var or backend auth for production.

## Next improvements (suggested)
- Replace mock OTP flow with a backend SMS provider.
- Integrate a proper map/polygon editor (Leaflet + draw plugin) for farm boundaries.
- Add forms validation & accessibility improvements.

## Development tips
- If you work from OneDrive and see file sync issues, consider moving the repo outside OneDrive.
- Use `git` to snapshot changes before big edits: `git add . && git commit -m "save"`.
